# Barmaid

Barmaid is a cross-platform desktop app that enables you to create a static webserver on your machine. Select a directory, choose a port and you're done: go to http://localhost:XXXX where XXXX is the port you chose.

Since version 1.1.0, you can enable auto-compile for jade/pug templates !
