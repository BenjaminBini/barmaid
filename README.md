# Barmaid

A small Mac GUI app to create a static webserver on your machine. Select a directory, choose a port and you're done: go to http://localhost:XXXX where XXXX is the port you chose.

## Download

You can download the app from the release tab or by following [this link](https://github.com/BenjaminBini/barmaid/releases/download/v1.0.0/barmaid.app.zip).

## From the source

To start the app from the sources, clone the repo and run these commands from the root folder:

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## On Windows

I don't use Windows so I can not test barmaid on Windows even if it should work properly. To use it on Windows run the commands from the previous paragraph.
